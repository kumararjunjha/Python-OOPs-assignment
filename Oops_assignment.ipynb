    "# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and programs. It utilizes several principles     including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "## 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "--> An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on the class blueprint, with actual values assigned to the attributes defined by     the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Animal(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "print(dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "--> Abstraction: \n",
    " The process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. \n",
    " It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    " Encapsulation: \n",
    "  The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, restricting \n",
    "  direct access to some of the object's components. It is a way to prevent accidental interference and misuse of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "--> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (__). They are used to            provide special functionality to classes, such as initialization, representation, and operator overloading.          \n",
    "\n",
    "class Sample:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Sample with value: {self.value}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code          reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but perform different tasks. This enables a single interface to represent        different underlying forms (data types).   \n",
    " \n",
    " class Bird:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Chirp\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "animals = [Bird(), Dog()]\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    animal.speak()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Chirp\n",
    "# Bark\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Encapsulation is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a class, restricting direct access to some of       the object's components. In Python, this is done by prefixing attribute names with an underscore _ or double underscore __ to indicate protected or     private access, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> A constructor in Python is a special method named __init__() that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It initializes    the object's attributes with the provided values.\n",
    " \n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, position):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.position = position\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "emp = Employee(\"Bob\", \"Manager\")\n",
    "print(emp.name)      # Output: Bob\n",
    "print(emp.position)  # Output: Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Class Methods: Defined with the @classmethod decorator, they take cls as the first parameter and can access or modify class state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static Methods: Defined with the @staticmethod decorator, they do not take self or cls as the first parameter and cannot access or modify class state.\n",
    "\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    factor = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def multiply_by_factor(cls, num):\n",
    "        return num * cls.factor\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "print(MathOperations.multiply_by_factor(5))  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(MathOperations.add_numbers(3, 4))      # Output: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Python does not support traditional method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) as seen in some other             languages. However, similar behavior can be achieved by providing default values for parameters or by using variable-length argument lists (*args       and **kwargs).       \n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the      subclass to modify or extend the behavior of that method.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> The @property decorator in Python allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. It is commonly used to implement getters and       setters, providing controlled access to instance attributes.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent            different underlying forms (data types), promoting flexibility and integration in code.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a blueprint for other classes. It can contain one or        more abstract methods, which are methods declared but contain no implementation. Abstract classes are defined using the abc module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
    "--> \n",
    "Modularity: Code is organized into classes, making it easier to manage and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Classes can be reused across different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: New functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: Encapsulation and modularity make code maintenance more straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Class Variable: Shared across all instances of a class. Defined within the class but outside any instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Instance Variable: Unique to each instance. Defined within methods, typically __init__, and prefixed with self.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows for the       combination of behaviors from multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python\n",
    "-->\n",
    "__str__: Defines the \"informal\" or user-friendly string representation of an object. It's what print() outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "__repr__: Defines the \"official\" string representation of an object, ideally one that could be used to recreate the object. It's what you get when you            enter the object in the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "--> The super() function returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing you to call its methods. It's commonly used to call the __init__ method     of the parent class to ensure proper initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python1\n",
    "--> The __del__ method is a destructor in Python, called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to release resources like files or network      connections. It's rarely used since Python's garbage collector manages memory automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python1\n",
    "--> @staticmethod: Does not take a reference to the class or instance. It's like a normal function but inside the class.\n",
    "--> @classmethod: Takes a reference to the class (cls) as the first argument, allowing access to class-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance1\n",
    "--> Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name but different implementations. The correct method is called based on the     object type, not the reference type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP1\n",
    "--> Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single line. Each method returns the object itself, enabling               subsequent method calls.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "--> The __call__ method allows an object to be invoked like a function. It is used when an object should behave like a callable entity."
